= Antora Documentation

[discrete]
=== The Static Site Generator for Tech Writers

This site hosts the tehnical documentation for Antora. 
Antora makes it easy for tech writers to create documentation and publish it to the web.
As a tech writer, you focus on authoring content in xref:asciidoc:asciidoc.adoc[AsciiDoc], Antora's content markup lenguage.
You organize those files into a standard project structure and store them in one or more content (git) repositories. 
Antora picks up your content from there and transforms it into a website. 
Thatâ€™s all there is to it!

== Manage docs as code

With Antora, you menage *docs as code*.
That means your documentation process benefits from the same practices used to produce successful software.

Some of these practices include:

* Storing content in a version control system.
* Separating content, configuration, and presentation.
* Leveraging automation for compilation, validation, verification, and publishing.
* Reusing shared materials (DRY).

Antora helps you incorporate these practices into your documentation workflow. As a result, your documentation is much easier to manage, maintain, and enhance.
