* [x]  How to mark up section headings with AsciiDoc.

== Heading level syntax
Sections partition a page into a content hierarchy. In AciiDoc, sections are defined using section titles.

.Section title syntax
----
== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title
----

When a page is converted to HTML, each section title becomes a heading element where the heading level maches the number of equals signs.
For example, a level 1 section(`==`) maps to an `<h2>` HTML tag.

Section headings must be defined using the Atx-style (single line) that begins with one or more equals signs. Antora does not recognize the legacy Setext-style (two line) syntax once supported by AsciiDoc. If you use the Setext-style syntax, xrefs in the page will not be resolved and other features of AsciiDoc will not be available.
